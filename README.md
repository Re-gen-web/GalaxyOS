#### What is Injector? 

Injector is a JavaScript bookmarklet developed by Paragram and some other people. It creates a pseudo desktop environment on the active page. It has multiple apps for games, proxying, chatting, ect, and it can be hidden at any time by simply pressing Right Shift. Its primary use is to circumvent school security mechanisms like iBoss, GoGuardian, Securly, Harpara, ect.

#### Features

##### Injector's currently included apps are as follows:
      Changelog: Lists most recent update's changes.
      Exploit Hub: Basic general use exploits.
      Chatbox2: A chatroom to talk to other Injector users, with indicators as to who is on the chatroom.
      ProxBrowser: A browser that proxies all sites you put into it, effectively unblocking sites.
      App Store: A place for 3rd party devs to upload apps.
      Game Hub: A place for well, games.
      Injector Cloud: Stores .txt files on the inject0r servers. You cannot edit files after creating them.
      Script Hub: Injector cloud, but for scripts. Runs the script when clicked.

##### App Store 
As mentioned in the Features tab, the App Store is a place for third party developers to upload their own apps. Apps downloaded on the App Store will save cross-site. Apps are not restricted to just windows, either; they can be libraries, themes, you name it. Apps are all verified through official Injector developers to ensure no malicious code is included. If you'd like to upload an app, make a issue and post your app code.
###### Developer Docs
In the discord, also check the github wiki.
